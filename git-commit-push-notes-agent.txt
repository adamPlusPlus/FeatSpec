Fix modal scrolling issues and add server scripts

- Fixed modal scrolling by adding overflow and flex properties to modal-body
- Fixed case selection modal scrolling with proper flex layout
- Renamed serve.sh to start-server.sh for clarity
- Added PowerShell version start-server.ps1 for Windows users
- Added missing reference documents (feature-spec-reference.md, master-pipeline-template.md)
- Removed hardcoded API keys from server.js (now requires CURSOR_API_KEY env var)
- Added server.log to .gitignore
- Updated .gitignore to exclude docs/, saved-files/, automation-output/, projects/, _test/
