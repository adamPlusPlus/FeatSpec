Fix missing _renderDependencyMiniGraph method in RenderingEngine

## Summary
Fixed rendering error where _renderDependencyMiniGraph method was missing from RenderingEngine.js, causing repeated errors on page load.

## Changes
- Added `_renderDependencyMiniGraph` method to RenderingEngine.js
- Method uses DependencyGraph class to render mini dependency graph
- Added click handler setup for mini graph items
- Added data-project-id attribute to mini graph container for proper handler setup

## Fix Details
The method was being called in `_renderSectionHeader` but was never implemented. The fix:
1. Creates a DependencyGraph instance
2. Calls renderMiniGraph to get HTML
3. Injects data-project-id attribute for click handler setup
4. Sets up click handlers after section view is rendered

## Error Fixed
- "[RenderingEngine] this._renderDependencyMiniGraph is not a function" - resolved
