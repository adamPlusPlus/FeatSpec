Separate Business Logic from Rendering and File Watching

Refactored RenderingEngine and AutomationSystem to extract business logic into dedicated service classes, addressing mixed concerns identified in code audit.

## New Service Classes Created

- SectionLogicService: Dependency checking, status determination, progress calculation
- NavigationService: Section navigation (previous/next), first incomplete section finding
- CaseInfoService: Case display names, badges, and chain information
- WorkflowContextService: Workflow context calculations (step position, totals)
- ProcessStepService: Process step trigger loading and button rendering
- PlaceholderService: Input placeholder loading and text extraction
- AutomationOrchestrator: Automation business logic coordination (section completion, state updates, navigation)

## Refactored Modules

- RenderingEngine: Now delegates all business logic to services, focused solely on DOM rendering
- AutomationSystem: Delegates business logic to AutomationOrchestrator, focused on file watching operations
- app.js: Initializes and wires up all new services, delegates checkDependencies and getFirstIncompleteSection to services

## Benefits

- Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
- Testability: Business logic can be tested independently
- Reusability: Services can be used by other modules
- Maintainability: Easier to understand and modify
- Reduced Coupling: Less dependency on window.app global

## Files Changed

- Created: modules/services/ directory with 7 new service classes
- Modified: modules/RenderingEngine.js (refactored to use services)
- Modified: modules/AutomationSystem.js (delegates to AutomationOrchestrator)
- Modified: app.js (initializes services, updates method delegations)
- Modified: index.html (added script tags for new services)
