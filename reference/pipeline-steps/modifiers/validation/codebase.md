# codebase Modifier

**Type**: Base Modifier
**Applies To**: Validation
**Case**: 1 (primary)

**Instructions**:

Validate extracted features against codebase implementation.

**Validation Tasks**:

1. **Cross-Reference Code with Documentation**
   - Verify features exist in code
   - Check documentation accuracy against implementation
   - Identify discrepancies
   - Note undocumented features in code

2. **Validate Extracted Features Against Implementation**
   - Verify feature behavior matches code
   - Check timing values against implementation
   - Validate visual properties against code
   - Verify edge cases are handled in code

3. **Check for Missing Code Paths**
   - Identify features in code not extracted
   - Find undocumented functionality
   - Note implementation details not captured
   - Identify code paths not covered

**Output Additions**:
- Code validation results
- Discrepancies between documentation and code
- Missing code paths identified
- Implementation verification
