# ui-only Modifier

**Type**: Base Modifier
**Applies To**: Validation
**Case**: 2 (primary)

**Instructions**:

Validate inferred features against observed UI behavior.

**Validation Tasks**:

1. **Cross-Reference UI Observations**
   - Verify inferred features match observed behavior
   - Check feature boundaries against UI structure
   - Validate interaction patterns against observations
   - Confirm visual properties match observations

2. **Validate Inferred Features Against Observed Behavior**
   - Verify feature behavior matches UI observations
   - Check timing values against observed timing
   - Validate visual properties against observed UI
   - Verify edge cases are observable in UI

3. **Check for Missing UI States**
   - Identify UI states not captured
   - Find unobserved interactions
   - Note UI behaviors not documented
   - Identify UI patterns not extracted

**Output Additions**:
- UI validation results
- Discrepancies between inference and observations
- Missing UI states identified
- Observation verification
